# Hi, I'm Phil
I have a passion for continuous learning and improvement in the ever-evolving IT landscape. At the moment I'm very much a generalist, having worked level 3 Helpdesk for an MSP I've touched 
all manner of environments. I'm working to specialize within Security Engineering, and my pursued certs and learning reflects this. I'm dedicated to mastering the art of maintaining robust, secure, and efficient IT systems.

### 🎓 Passion for Knowledge Sharing and Learning
My mission is fueled by a passion for knowledge sharing and continuous learning. I founded my Universities Cybersecurity club and hosted workshops, labs, cert study groups, hackathons, and brought in speakers from across the country for events. I'm committed to elevating my peers and continue this knowledge sharing post-graduation through blog posts and discussion within a tech forum I manage. Information wants to be free, and gatekeeping ones knowledge or skills to "gain an edge" is folly, the security landscape improves when adminstrators and engineers are empowered by the community and their peers.
